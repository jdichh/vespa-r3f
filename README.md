# Vespa 125 Promotional Website
This is a promotional website for the Vespa 125 made with React-Three-Fiber, GSAP and Tailwind. <br/>
I made this to learn how those YouTube videos of projects made with R3F are made scrollable with GSAP.

I sourced the [model of the Vespa from Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/vespa-368aeee32a784480acae4608441db325).
