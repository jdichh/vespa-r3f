# Vespa 125 Promotional Website
This is a promotional website for the Vespa 125 made with React-Three-Fiber, GSAP and Tailwind. <br/>
I made this to learn how those YouTube videos of projects made with R3F are made scrollable with GSAP.

## Disclaimer
I am NOT in any way shape or form, affiliated with Piaggio and/or Vespa. This is just a personal project to learn from. <br/>
I sourced the [model of the Vespa from Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/vespa-368aeee32a784480acae4608441db325).

## Project setup
If you want to try this out for yourself, download the source code, open the folder in VSCode/VSCodium, and run these lines of code.
```
pnpm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
